# Marketplace Logos

Please add the official logos for each marketplace in this directory:

1. **blinkit.svg** - Official Blinkit logo (download from https://blinkit.com or their brand guidelines)
2. **myntra.svg** - Official Myntra logo (download from https://www.myntra.com or their brand guidelines)
3. **flipkart.svg** - Official Flipkart logo (download from https://www.flipkart.com or their brand guidelines)
4. **amazon.svg** - Official Amazon logo (download from https://www.amazon.com or their brand guidelines)

## Where to find official logos:

- **Blinkit**: Visit blinkit.com and check their footer or brand resources
- **Myntra**: Visit myntra.com and check their brand/media kit
- **Flipkart**: Visit flipkart.com and check their brand guidelines
- **Amazon**: Visit amazon.com/about or search for "Amazon brand guidelines"

## File format:
- Use SVG format for best quality and scalability
- Ensure logos are properly sized (recommended: 120-200px width)
- Keep file names lowercase with .svg extension

## Alternative:
If you can't find SVG files, you can use PNG files with transparent backgrounds:
- blinkit.png
- myntra.png
- flipkart.png
- amazon.png

The component will automatically use these files once they're added to this directory.
